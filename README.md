# LEI - Big Data

This project consists in a FUSE filesystem complemented with tracing functionalities. The result of the tracing system is further used in Elastic Search in order to analyze data and discover potential problems.

# ðŸš€ Getting Started

## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

In order to run the project you need to install the following:

* fuse
* libfuse-dev
* python
* elasticsearch
* kibana
* gcc

This project is **only compatible with Ubuntu** and probably won't work on MacOS.

## ðŸ“¦ Running


### Python Server

In order to run the python server which connects the filesystem to our elastic search storage, you just need to run the following:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

### Fuse Filesystem

The `fuse`folder contains a `Makefile` wich can be used the following way:

If you want to compile and mount(run) the flesystem:

```bash
make all
```

or

```bash
make compile
make run
```

If you want to unmount the filesystem you just need to run:

```bash
make end
```

In order to run one of the three test programs, you can use the following commands:

```bash
make compile
make rocks (or) make psql (or) make tensor
```

### Elastic Search & Kibana

## :nerd_face: How it Works

When running `make run` (which is included in `make all`), you are mounting the folder `fs_data` which in the mountpoint `fs`. The result is a filesystem located at the mountpoint which supports our tracing fuctionality.

The system call used in this filesystem are captured and sent via sockets to the `server` we built in python. This server processes this data by inserting it in Elastic Search.
